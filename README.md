# meucurriculum

My first project on the web. Something like a improved hello world. A lot of <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, a bit of <b>PHP</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.

The content of this site is finished and outdated. Today I use another way to edit and publish my curriculum (especially <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alcalcides/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #6F6F5F;">linkedin.com/in/alcalcides/</a>). 

Maybe I'll go back in the future.
